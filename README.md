# ATAK Imagery

Cross-platform ATAK imagery pipeline with simple one-click install.

## Linux: run `install_linux.sh` first

On Linux, **always run the installer before using the apps**. The file **`install_linux.sh`** in the **project root** (same folder as `README.md`) prepares **both** programs—**ATAK Device Installer** and **ATAK Imagery Downloader**—and the Python environment they rely on. Skipping it and running the `.py` files by hand will usually fail or miss dependencies.

Source repository: `https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery`

### How to run the installer

1. Put the project on your machine and open a **terminal**:
   - **Clone:** `git clone https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery.git` then `cd atak-imagery`
   - **Linux install zip:** under [Releases](https://github.com/atakmaps/atak-imagery/releases), download **`atak-imagery-v*-linux-install.zip`** for your version from **Assets** (not the auto-generated “Source code (zip)”, which uses a different folder layout). The **Assets** zip stores every file under a root directory **`atak-imagery/`** inside the archive.

     Run `unzip` in the **same directory as the `.zip` file** (a **parent** folder—usually `Downloads`). That directory will gain a **`atak-imagery`** folder next to the zip:

     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     unzip atak-imagery-v1.3.0-linux-install.zip
     ls atak-imagery/install_linux.sh
     cd atak-imagery
     chmod +x install_linux.sh
     ./install_linux.sh
     ```

     If `ls` does not show `install_linux.sh` under `atak-imagery/`, you may have unzipped from **inside** an empty `atak-imagery` you created first (that nests a second `atak-imagery`). Remove that folder, stay in the parent directory (e.g. `Downloads`), and run `unzip` again. Use the real zip filename if you downloaded a different release.

     The script may ask for **`sudo`** for system packages. Some file managers can run `install_linux.sh` with a double-click; if nothing happens, use the terminal block above.

2. If you **cloned** instead of using the zip, run the installer from the repo root:

   ```bash
   cd atak-imagery
   chmod +x install_linux.sh
   ./install_linux.sh
   ```

### What `install_linux.sh` does

The root script runs **`scripts/install_linux.sh`**, which:

- Installs or checks **system packages** needed for the pipeline (Python 3, pip/venv, Tkinter, Zenity, Android **adb**, etc.) via apt, dnf, or pacman when it recognizes your distro.
- Creates or repairs a **virtual environment** at **`.venv/`** and installs Python dependencies from **`requirements.txt`**.
- Copies **`deploy.env.example`** to **`deploy.env`** the first time, so **ATAK Device Installer** has a config template to edit.
- Writes **`run_atak_pipeline_with_device.sh`** and **`run_atak_pipeline.sh`** in the project root (wrappers that call the correct Python entry points with that venv).
- Installs **two desktop shortcuts** (under `~/.local/share/applications/` and on `~/Desktop` when it exists):
  - **ATAK Device Installer** — USB setup: install ATAK and your plugin on the phone, then continue into the map workflow.
  - **ATAK Imagery Downloader** — download imagery and build packages when the device is already configured.

After a successful run, use those desktop entries or the two shell scripts above. You only need to run **`install_linux.sh`** again if you move the tree, recreate the venv, or need to refresh system/Python dependencies.

## Command-line tile download (no phone, no GUI)

`scripts/xyz_tile_download.py` downloads the same imagery (USGS below z16, Google Hybrid z16–20) into a plain `{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg` tree. You don't need a phone, USB debugging, or a desktop session. Any offline slippy-map viewer can read the output. For example, copy it to `/tiles` on a Squatch Mesh SD card. In a terminal it shows a live dashboard (press `q` to stop). Use `--plain` for plain log lines.

```bash
PY=.venv/bin/python   # venv created by install_linux.sh
# 10-mile radius, zooms 3-16
$PY scripts/xyz_tile_download.py --center 47.66 -117.42 --radius 10 --zoom 3-16 -o ~/tiles
# Same area as an existing ATAK imagery package
$PY scripts/xyz_tile_download.py --like ATAK_SQL_Sandpoint.sqlite --zoom 3-16 -o ~/tiles
# Whole states, or a bbox (west south east north); --dry-run only counts tiles
$PY scripts/xyz_tile_download.py --state Idaho --bbox -117.6 47.5 -117.2 47.8 --zoom 3-13 -o ~/tiles --dry-run
```

You can combine areas, and re-runs skip tiles already on disk. After a download, the script warns about tiles over 96 KB and about progressive JPEGs, because small firmware decoders can't use either (`--check-kb 0` skips this check).

## Current stable release (Linux / source)

**Linux / source release:** `v1.3.50` (tag **`v1.3.50`** on GitHub).

**Windows:** Same version as Linux (`v1.3.50`). Build on a Windows VM with PyInstaller — see **Windows build** below.

Version **1.3.50** highlights:

- **UV-PRO install fix:** Device Installer now picks the signed **release** APK (not the debug build) when matching ATAK 5.6.x on GitHub Latest.

### Previous release (v1.3.49)

- **Version on welcome screen:** Device Installer and Imagery Downloader show the installed release version on the first screen.

### Previous release (v1.3.48)

- **Radius coverage UI:** “Calculating coverage…” keeps the progress bar moving and shows per-zoom status during long high-zoom tile counts.
- **Radius download name:** name field stays editable when fixed-radius mode is selected (Linux/Tk fix).
- **Add-on installs:** continue past individual plugin failures; no stale local APK fallback when `*-plugin-assets` tags are configured.
- **Install upgrades:** `install_linux.sh` refreshes `deploy.env` plugin-assets tags to match `VERSION`.
- **Linux install zip:** ships runtime + `README.md` only (no agent handoffs or Windows build docs).

### Previous release (v1.3.47)

- **Lean Linux install zip:** release packaging no longer ships local add-on APKs or `tmp/` test data (~133 MB vs ~640 MB); Imagery Downloader fetches plugins from the matching `*-plugin-assets` GitHub release.
- **Windows parity:** Windows sync no longer embeds bundled plugin APKs in EXEs — same GitHub asset download path as Linux.
- **Protected import reliability:** `deploy.env` is loaded before downloader constants; `install_linux.sh` seeds plugin-assets release tags from `VERSION`; improved protected-import logging and download error handling.

### Previous release (v1.3.46)

- **AmRRON report forms:** password-protected install includes `AmRRON Forms.xml` → `/sdcard/atak/tools/reports/templates`.
- **Protected import routing:** per-asset device paths (CSV → `tools/import`, report templates → `tools/reports/templates`).

### Previous release (v1.3.45)

- **ATAK 5.6 plugin matching:** Device Installer picks the GitHub release APK that matches the manifest ATAK version (e.g. `uv-560.apk` / `mesh-560.apk` for 5.6, not `uv-551.apk`).
- **ATAK install recovery:** signature mismatch on ATAK upgrade triggers uninstall + retry (same as plugins).

### Previous release (v1.3.43)

- **Windows in-app update (fixed):** Update now always downloads `ATAKSetup-v*.exe` and runs the installer — no browser, no “How do you want to open this file?” dialog.
- **Recursive local imagery/DTED lookup:** pick a parent folder; tiles and DTED ZIPs are found anywhere under it.
- **Local scan progress** and **Existing** tile logging during download.

### Previous release (v1.3.42)

- First attempt at direct Windows installer download (browser fallback when GitHub API omitted the exe asset).

### Previous release (v1.3.41)

- **Windows auto-update fix:** frozen EXEs read `VERSION` from the install folder for release comparison.

### Previous release (v1.3.40)

- **Google Hybrid radius imagery:** fixed-radius downloads can fetch bundled `google_hybrid.xml` tiles at zoom **16–20** (entire-state downloads remain USGS z10–15). See README user-acceptance note for third-party tile use.
- **Radius DTED clip:** DTED extract/pack now keeps only cells overlapping the radius bbox; logs clarify that full state ZIPs are still downloaded from the server before clipping.
- **Download ETA accuracy:** zoom-screen and live progress ETA use parallel-aware throughput (USGS + Google probe on radius jobs) and correct down faster when speed exceeds early estimates.

### Previous release (v1.3.38)

- **Meshcore out-of-box install:** Device Installer now downloads TAK-MESHCORE from GitHub Releases by default (`atakmaps/TAK-MESHCORE`), matching UV-PRO — no local Plugins folder required.
- **deploy.env backfill:** missing keys from `deploy.env.example` are merged on startup so existing installs pick up new settings without manual edits.
- **Linux install defaults:** `install_linux.sh` seeds `ATAK_MESHCORE_PLUGIN_GITHUB_REPO` on first run.

### Previous release (v1.3.37)

- **New Meshcore install options:** Device Installer now includes `ATAK + TAK-MESHCORE plugin` and `TAK-MESHCORE plugin only` in the install-choice screen.
- **Multi-plugin install routing:** plugin install step now resolves and installs either UV-PRO or Meshcore based on selection while preserving existing wizard step flow.
- **Meshcore source support:** installer can resolve Meshcore APKs from `ATAK_MESHCORE_PLUGIN_APK`, `ATAK_MESHCORE_PLUGIN_REPO`, or default local Meshcore folder.

### Previous release (v1.3.36)

- **Installer lockup fix after device connect:** ATAK install/plugin steps now run in worker threads so step 3 no longer freezes the UI when Continue is pressed.
- **Thread-safe UI updates:** installer status/progress updates are marshaled onto Tk via async UI calls to avoid main-loop stalls during network/adb operations.
- **Installer diagnostics:** added clearer step logging around manifest fetch/resolve/install paths to pinpoint slow or blocked stages.

### Previous release (v1.3.35)

- **Protected CSV import flow:** imagery downloader now supports password-protected release zip assets for import files and installs decrypted CSVs to `/sdcard/atak/tools/import`.
- **No password in repo:** protected file install prompts user at runtime and validates by decrypting the encrypted asset, with no stored compare password in source.
- **Protected import defaults:** includes default protected asset support for `AmRRON-Default-v1.0.csv.zip` via release assets.

### Previous release (v1.3.34)

- **Live add-on download progress:** plugin downloads now emit in-flight byte progress so large APK transfers visibly advance instead of appearing stuck.
- **Startup diagnostics hardening:** startup update-check phases now log begin/complete and catch/log exceptions to avoid silent early exits.
- **Welcome exit clarity:** welcome-screen exits now log explicit reason (`continue`, `quit_button`, `window_close`) instead of ambiguous cancel wording.

### Previous release (v1.3.33)

- **Plugin refresh UX update:** add-on plugin refresh now shows full plugin rows with `Remove` and `Install` columns, per-plugin size lines, and live totals for install/remove actions.
- **Deferred plugin downloads:** plugin APKs are no longer downloaded before selection; download happens only for user-selected installs after confirmation.
- **Progress accuracy:** add-on refresh progress now advances through remove/download/install/push steps instead of remaining at 0%.

### Previous release (v1.3.32)

- **Plugin source migration:** imagery downloader add-on plugins now resolve from GitHub release assets (or explicit URLs) with local fallback, reducing repo/source bloat from bundled APKs.
- **Installer/downloader split clarified:** Device Installer no longer installs additional add-on plugins; those installs are downloader-managed only.
- **Add-on file routing update:** KML add-ons (including repeater KML files) are now included explicitly alongside XML/KMZ/ZIP add-on deployment.

### Previous release (v1.3.31)

- **Installer step-3 crash hardening:** ATAK install flow now runs entirely on the Tk main thread, removing worker-thread Tk callback usage in this step.
- **Tcl stability fix:** reduces `Tcl_AsyncDelete: async handler deleted by the wrong thread` crashes reported immediately after entering step 3 (“Installing ATAK”).

### Previous release (v1.3.30)

- **SSL-safe Python selection:** installer now selects a Python interpreter with working `ssl` + `venv` support (prefers `/usr/bin/python3`) to avoid broken custom PATH Python builds.
- **Desktop icon reliability:** installer now resolves the desktop folder using `xdg-user-dir DESKTOP` and writes launchers there, improving icon creation on systems that do not use `~/Desktop`.

### Previous release (v1.3.29)

- **APT venv fallback fix:** Linux installer no longer hard-fails when `pythonX.Y-venv` is missing from apt repositories.
- **Mixed Python env support:** installer now falls back to `python3-venv` and retries dependency install automatically when version-specific venv package lookup fails.

### Previous release (v1.3.28)

- **Linux desktop shortcut cleanup:** installer now removes legacy ATAK pipeline `.desktop` launchers before writing current shortcuts.
- **Expected launcher behavior restored:** rerunning installer now leaves only `ATAK Device Installer` and `ATAK Imagery Downloader`.

### Previous release (v1.3.27)

- **Installer plugin sequencing fix:** in ATAK + UV-PRO mode, bundled add-on plugins now install while ATAK is closed so they do not all trigger load prompts.
- **UV-PRO notification targeting:** installer now launches ATAK, waits 15 seconds, then installs UV-PRO last so only UV-PRO prompts to load in-app.

### Previous release (v1.3.26)

- **Installer plugin-only crash hardening:** plugin install step now runs on the Tk main thread to avoid cross-thread Tk callback crashes seen on some Linux systems/devices.
- **Stability in step-5 transition:** removes worker-thread UI scheduling in the plugin-only path that could abort around “Installing plugin” before install logs appeared.

### Previous release (v1.3.25)

- **Packaging hygiene:** Linux release bundling excludes `windows_build/` content from linux-install assets.

### Previous release (v1.3.21)

- **Radius stability fixes:** avoided `Tcl_AsyncDelete` crashes by moving radius DTED state-geometry resolution to preloaded main-thread state data.
- **Cancelable tile planning:** cancel now interrupts state tile-plan computation while planning is still running.
- **Radius DTED clip:** radius runs now clip DTED packaging to radius-overlapping DTED cells instead of packing whole-state extracts.

### Previous release (v1.3.20)

- **Foreground dialog behavior:** “Calculating coverage”, download summary, and directory picker dialogs now stay on top instead of opening behind other windows.
- **Add-ons refresh-only bug fix:** when no bundled add-ons are present, the downloader now reports “nothing to refresh” and completes cleanly instead of showing an error.
- **Bundled plugin cleanup:** removed the bundled WASP APK from `scripts/data/bundled_plugins`.

### Previous release (v1.3.19)

- **Radius zoom range reset:** removed z17/z18 selection from the downloader UI; both state and radius workflows now cap at z16.
- **Imagery-only startup flow hardening:** imagery-only mode now follows the same skip-intro workflow used by maps+add-ons, avoiding the separate upfront device-check path that was reported as crashing.
- **Linux/Windows parity:** the same downloader behavior changes were applied in both `scripts/` and `windows_build/` script variants.

### Previous release (v1.3.18)

- **Installer plugin-step UI cleanup:** removed text indicating bundled add-on plugin installation from the "Installing plugin" window.
- **Current behavior reflected in wizard copy:** plugin installation messaging now reflects UV-PRO-only install behavior.

### Previous release (v1.3.17)

- **Installer downgrade recovery:** when plugin install returns `INSTALL_FAILED_VERSION_DOWNGRADE`, the installer now retries downgrade flags and, if still blocked, performs a full uninstall/reinstall recovery automatically.
- **Strict uninstall verification for plugin-only flow:** plugin-only install now verifies the old UV-PRO package is truly removed before proceeding, reducing repeated version-code mismatch failures.
- **Improved package-state checks:** installer now checks package presence directly via `pm list packages` to make uninstall handling deterministic across devices.

### Previous release (v1.3.16)

- **Precomputed tile-plan cache refresh:** updated `scripts/data/tile_plans/v1/*.tiles.gz` coverage now includes states through Illinois to reduce state-planning compute time during imagery runs.
- **Faster first-run state planning on included states:** downloader can load cache-backed tile plans (`Tile plan (cache)`) for newly included states instead of recomputing.
- **Linux install bundle updated:** release asset includes the refreshed tile-plan cache set.

### Previous release (v1.3.15)

- **Device Installer (plugin-only) reliability:** plugin-only flow now force-uninstalls the old UV-PRO package before install to avoid version/signature mismatch, then proceeds through the plugin confirmation workflow and completion path.
- **Maps + add-ons UX flow:** when both options are selected, add-ons preflight runs before imagery, including completion messaging and disconnect guidance before download scope.
- **Radius zoom options expanded:** radius mode now offers zoom levels through **z18** (state mode remains capped at **z16**) with an explicit warning about z17/z18 data growth.

### Previous release (v1.3.14)

- **Add-ons refresh workflow hardening:** the downloader now uses the same checked add-ons routine (close ATAK, verify device, detect missing items, confirm install list) for both **refresh-only** and **maps + refresh** flows.
- **Maps + refresh execution order:** when both options are selected, add-ons refresh runs first. A completion dialog confirms device work is done before imagery starts.
- **KMZ/ZIP delivery path update:** `.kmz` and `.zip` add-ons are now copied to **`/sdcard/Download`** for manual ATAK import; the pipeline no longer unzips KML bundles automatically.

### Previous release (v1.3.13)

- **Imagery Downloader — same add-ons as the device installer:** after a successful download (and DTED stage), the downloader **pushes** everything under `scripts/data/mobile_xml/` (map XML, KMZ, import ZIPs) and **installs** bundled add-on APKs from `scripts/data/bundled_plugins/` when `ANDROID_SERIAL` is set — matching the installer bundles. **TAK‑UV‑PRO** is still not bundled; it is only installed via the Device Installer flow.
### Previous release (v1.3.12)

- **Device Installer — bundled add-on plugins:** extra ATAK plugin APKs under `scripts/data/bundled_plugins/` are installed over adb after the appropriate step (**ATAK only** → after ATAK + map assets; **ATAK + UV‑PRO** or **plugin only** → after TAK‑UV‑PRO). **TAK‑UV‑PRO** is never bundled; it still comes only from GitHub Releases / manifest / `deploy.env` so devices always pick up the latest published build.
- **Map / import add-ons:** `scripts/data/mobile_xml/` continues to ship map-source XML, KMZ, and import ZIPs (synced from your local “Add Ons for Build” folder before release). Subfolders are supported; device push uses each file’s basename.
- **Large CIV loadout zips:** multi‑gigabyte `ATAK-CIV*_loadout.zip` files are **gitignored**; copy them into `scripts/data/mobile_xml/` on the machine that runs `scripts/build_release.py` if the published Linux install zip must include them.

### Previous release (v1.3.11)

- **Device Installer — session log file:** the installer writes a timestamped log (and updates `LATEST_LOG.txt` in the same folder) so crashes after “Continue” can be diagnosed. Paths: `scripts/logs/` when run from source, or `~/.local/share/atak-pipeline/installer_logs/` when bundled. Stderr prints `Installer log: …` on startup.

### Previous release (v1.3.10)

- **Download-first workflow restored:** standalone imagery runs now skip upfront device verification, download imagery first, then prompt once to connect the device before the DTED/device check stage.
- **DTED local-path browser restored:** the "Local Elevation Location" selector is back on the download scope screen so local state ZIP trees can be used before network fetches.
- **State-name URL fix for DTED server paths:** multi-word state names now map to underscore server slugs (for example `North_Dakota`) so valid server files are found.
- **Stability fix for Linux Tk crash:** state boundary GeoJSON loading is preloaded on the main thread before worker startup to avoid the `Tcl_AsyncDelete` crash path seen during state-mode downloads.

### Previous release (v1.3.9)

- **Cancel works immediately during DTED download:** pressing Cancel now responds within one 256 KB chunk instead of waiting for the entire state ZIP to finish. The cancel signal is checked on every chunk in `download_file`; the partial `.part` file is cleaned up automatically.
- **Suppress benign semaphore warning:** the `resource_tracker: leaked semaphore` warning that appeared on exit after a cancel is now suppressed — it was harmless noise from the hard-exit path.

### Previous release (v1.3.8)

- **Imagery Downloader — DTED state dialog removed:** the "Local Elevation Location" section has been fully removed from the download scope screen; DTED is always handled automatically.
- **Imagery Downloader — DTED skip flag fix:** `mark_standalone_dted_skip()` is now set as soon as DTED processing begins, not only when a new zip is produced. This prevents the standalone DTED downloader from launching after the SQLite build when all required states were already on the device.
- **Imagery Downloader — "Calculating coverage" window:** the zenity progress window shown while computing radius tile counts is now wider (400 × 120 px) so the text fits comfortably.
- **Window stacking — no more rapid flashing:** `ensure_window_stacking` now does three quiet nudges (150 ms apart) instead of 30 pulses per 3 seconds, and `focus_force()` has been removed — eliminating the rapid-pulse visual artifact seen on the installer and summary dialogs.

### Previous release (v1.3.0)

- **Device Installer — installer-only mode:** no longer launches the imagery downloader automatically. A new **install selection screen** lets you choose ATAK + Plugin, ATAK only, or Plugin only. A final completion screen confirms the install and reminds you to run the imagery downloader separately.
- **Device Installer — signature mismatch recovery:** if the device has the plugin signed with a different certificate (`INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`), the installer automatically performs a full uninstall then reinstalls cleanly — no manual intervention required.
- **Device Installer — ATAK setup bold note:** step 4 now shows a bold reminder to complete the ATAK setup before clicking Continue.
- **Imagery Downloader — radius naming:** a name field on the “Select radius or state” screen lets you give each radius download a unique name, preventing subsequent builds from overwriting previous ones. The field is disabled unless radius mode is selected.
- **Imagery Downloader — zoom cascade in radius mode:** selecting a zoom level now auto-selects all coarser zooms (same pyramid behavior as state mode).
- **DTED — conditional download:** before downloading, the pipeline queries the device’s installed DTED manifest (`.dted_states.json`). States already on the device are skipped; only missing states are downloaded and pushed. The manifest is updated on the device after each successful push.
- **Window stacking:** improved `ensure_window_stacking` reliability on Linux/X11 window managers.

**Auto-update requirements:** **Git** on `PATH`, network to `origin`, and a clone with `origin` pointing at this repository. Release zips and PyInstaller bundles without `.git` skip the check silently.

**Maintainer note (Windows / PyInstaller):** When packaging with a `.spec` that lists hidden imports explicitly, include **`tk_window_scaling`** and **`git_update_check`**.

### Previous release (v1.2.0)

- **Screen-aware Tk windows** (`scripts/tk_window_scaling.py`): main dialogs scale to fit small laptops and grow modestly on large displays.
- **Optional in-app update check** (`scripts/git_update_check.py`): when running from a git clone, fetches `origin/main` in the background and offers to pull and restart if new commits exist.
- **Linux install zip on Releases:** full tree under `atak-imagery/` for `install_linux.sh`; built with `python3 scripts/build_release.py`.
- **Tile-plan cache policy:** keep `scripts/data/tile_plans/v1/*.tiles.gz` out of git history; include them in the release zip asset instead.
- **One-command upload:** `scripts/build_and_upload_release_asset.sh <tag>` builds `dist/atak-imagery-v*-linux-install.zip` and uploads it to the GitHub release.

### Previous release (v1.0.0)

- **ATAK Device Installer**: production wizard only (debug skip controls removed); post-plugin instructions including device **OK** for plugin install; **Continue** before launching the imagery downloader
- **ATAK Imagery Downloader**: same SQLite handoff dialog when launched from the installer as in standalone; blocks **District of Columbia** as the only state selection, with an explanation; clearer errors when no states remain to download
- **DTED step**: pushes per-state `ATAK_SQL*.sqlite` file(s) and the DTED zip to the device under `/sdcard/atak/imagery` and `/sdcard/atak/DTED` (override with `ATAK_DEVICE_FILES_ROOT`); post-build **Yes/No** raw-imagery cleanup; adb restart of ATAK and completion dialog
- **Installer**: `deploy.env.example` seed; portable root paths in root launchers

## Overview

This project provides a streamlined pipeline for:

- imagery download
- SQLite creation for ATAK imagery packages
- DTED package download
- final ATAK-ready output packaging

### Google Hybrid imagery (radius downloads only)

The Imagery Downloader can fetch **Google Hybrid** tiles (from bundled `google_hybrid.xml`) for **fixed-radius** jobs at **zoom 16–20**. Entire-state downloads remain **USGS orthophoto only** (zoom 10–15).

**User acceptance:** By using Google Hybrid zoom levels in the Imagery Downloader, you accept that:

- Tile requests are sent to third-party map servers (not USGS).
- You are responsible for complying with the tile provider’s terms and for how you use offline copies.
- High zoom levels (especially 18–20) can produce **very large** downloads that take a long time and use substantial disk space on your PC and Android device.

There is no in-app prompt for this; continuing with a radius download that includes zoom 16–20 constitutes acceptance.

Primary Linux/source scripts:

- `scripts/atak_downloader_finalbuild.py` — standalone Imagery Downloader
- `scripts/atak_downloader_from_installer.py` — same core, launched only after Device Installer
- `scripts/atak_imagery_sqlite_builder_finalbuild.py`
- `scripts/atak_dted_downloader.py`
- `scripts/build_tile_plan_cache.py` — optional: precompute per-state tile lists into `data/tile_plans/v1/*.tiles.gz` so downloads skip the slow “scanning tile coverage” step (see `scripts/data/tile_plans/README.md`)
- `scripts/git_update_check.py` — optional startup update offer for git clones (`origin/main`)
- `scripts/tk_window_scaling.py` — scales Tk geometry to the display

Windows-specific build copies (synced from `scripts/` via `scripts/sync_windows_build.py`):

- `windows_build/atak_adb_deploy_win.py` — Device Installer
- `windows_build/atak_downloader_finalbuild_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_downloader_from_installer_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_imagery_sqlite_builder_finalbuild_win.py`
- `windows_build/atak_dted_downloader_win.py`

### Windows build (maintainer / VM)

**One-click setup for a fresh Windows PC** — from repo root, double-click or run:

```cmd
install_windows.cmd
```

Automated steps: Python → adb → build both EXEs → install to **`%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\ATAK Pipeline\`** → Desktop icons for **Device Installer** and **Imagery Downloader**.

Log: `setup_windows.log`. Chooser: `Run_ATAK_Pipeline.cmd`.

After `git pull`, rerun `install_windows.cmd` to refresh.

**Rebuild EXEs only** (deps already installed):

---

## Critical Project Rule

**Do not treat Linux runtime scripts and Windows EXE scripts as the same thing anymore.**

### Linux / source truth

Linux runtime and source-truth pipeline live in:

```text
scripts/
```
